<p>With Umbraco you've finally got a solid, open and reliable platform for websites as basic as the Txt site, and Umbraco can be rapidly expanded to support multi-language websites, collaboration platforms and intra/extranets, to name just a few.</p>

Create and integrate your own .NET macros in mere minutes with point and click simplicity. Simply copy your controls to the Umbraco website, go to the <strong>Developer</strong> section and create a new macro, selecting your control from the list.</p>
